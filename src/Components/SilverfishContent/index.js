            alt= "A red hue, hazy bathrooms, intertwined with medical and military operations. A monochrome, shallow, square tray takes centre. A swelling erupts from the plughole, mutating into a silverfish form. Lumpy dismembered swellings float faintly. The hue softens into a fleshy pink. A close up of the silverfish divides the screen. A new green limb protrudes from a tough, dark exterior. The first silverfish with large fangs bites through the air at pace. A second silverfish, with a striped tubular frame fades in and out. A corroded shower oozes a maggot-like liquid, falling on the first silverfish. It screams and mutates, flicking its tail and spluttering out bodily fluid. The fluid pours down screen to reveal the first silverfish face on, breathing heavily. Green eggs appear, a large one opens up to reveal an internal silverfish. Meanwhile behind, teeth circulate the screen as it is progressively swallowed. Abruptly, a new more mechanically advanced silverfish vibrates onto screen. Glitching forward and closer. It crawls with 2 bird like limbs, sluggish its vehicle faÃ§ade contrasts with its fleshy body. It moves into complete darkness. The pink fleshy background returns in rectangular layers. A new limb, missile like, squirms out of this silverfishes body. It pixelates, mirrors itself and blurs out. This missile flails incoherently, eventually biting itself to draw a rich pink blood. A snippet of an evolved missile beast flashes, while the newly formed one attacks its hosts body. Blood emerges. The evolved missile, spotted and mechanical in nature fires. A further evolved silverfish crawls into focus. Sharp, dark, a worm like body, adorned with technology. Rotted bathrooms tessellate as a monster formed of a tumour and facial structure that mimics a tap appears. As it disappears a small spikey slug like prey enters the bathroom and is quickly chased by the original silverfish. Sections of all the silverfishes are hacked into one graphic montage, created a motionless image of a beast. The tap monster levitates over the worm like silverfish, pouring a toxic pink sludge over it. The tubular silverfish pixelates and multiplies onto the screen. It consumes the screen, its antennae wiggling frantically. An ominous form with a green swelling divides the screen, blurring whilst the orginal silverfish passes by. As the ominous form increases in size, a new silverfish with a long black neck and sharp teeth riddles its green swelling slowly. The original silverfish chases it in order to consume it, while all the silverfish creatures are overlayed in sections. With a pale pink almost violet bathroom the long necked silverfish is dismembered with green isides exposed. It is feasted on by all the silverfish. A mechanical arm appears out of the darkness, followed by another smaller one which has an alien like appearance. Both arms take the dismembered limbs to create a new silverfish. The large arm then turns on the smaller one ripping its head off. The fresh silverfish comes to life, slivering through a green metallic blood. A black ooze pours down the screen and the credits roll. SILVERFISH. Visuals lily wales. Sound Christopher bunny warren. Typography Jodi hunt"
